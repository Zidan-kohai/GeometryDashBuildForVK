This is the folder where the game will look for any audio files that can be used in game as songs.

The game supports MP3, WAV and OGG as songs currently.
Any other file type is simply ignored.

Song files placed in subfolders of this songs folder are loaded as well.
This is how you create song categories in game.
For example: "Main Songs" is a category of songs used in the levels of the game.

If you are not seeing your custom song in game, then try the following:
1. Check if the file is placed in this songs folder or any subfolders of the songs folder.
2. Check if the file ends with ".mp3", ".wav" or ".ogg".
3. Hit the reload button in game to reload all the songs in the game.
